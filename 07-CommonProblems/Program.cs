        // 1. Double check the data type, should it really be "String"?
        // 2. Are we using ReadLine and WriteLine correctly?
        // 3. Did we forget to use "quotation marks" around a string
        // 4. Is there a missing semicolon somewhere?
        // 5. Are all of the braces (curly brackets) correct?
